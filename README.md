OneInstaller is powered by ONElua "Lua Interpreter for PSP".
Written By Davis Nu√±ez in 2015 (c).

Is a Autoinstaller content via Red, with simple but powerful GUI for psp!

This is an example of using APIs http to http download and send information through sockets.

It is an old project but suppose someone will serve you something to learn using http requests, or simply to understand the code of curiosity.
