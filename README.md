# OneInstaller
A simple Wiki Homebrew!

This is an example of using APIs http to http download and send information through sockets.

OneInstaller is powered by ONElua "Lua Interpreter for PSP".

It is an old project but suppose someone will serve you something to learn using http requests, or simply to understand the code of curiosity.
